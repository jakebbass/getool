🤖 Copilot Prompt: ElevenLabs Outbound AI Sales Agent via Make.com
Goal: Generate a detailed JSON blueprint for a Make.com scenario that connects a Clay Webhook to the ElevenLabs Conversational AI Outbound Call API, including a dynamic custom variable for personalization.

1. Core Scenario Requirements
The Make.com scenario must consist of two main modules:

Webhook Module (Trigger):

Listens for an HTTP POST request (a webhook) from Clay.

This webhook will contain the dynamic data needed to initiate the call.

HTTP Module (Action):

Makes an authenticated API call to the ElevenLabs Outbound Call API endpoint using the xi-api-key header.

The payload (body) of this API call must be a JSON object that includes custom variables to personalize the call agent's opening line.

2. Input Data (From Clay Webhook)
The expected structure of the JSON payload sent from the Clay webhook to the Make.com Webhook Module is as follows:

Variable Name	Example Value	Description
to_number	+14155551212	The prospect's phone number.
personalized_opener	just saw you raised your Series A last week	The tailored script line generated by Clay's AI.
prospect_name	Jane Doe	The prospect's first and last name.

3. ElevenLabs API Configuration
The Make.com HTTP module must be configured to call the ElevenLabs API for an outbound call (assuming the agent is connected via Twilio, which is the most common setup for ElevenLabs Agents):

Method: POST

URL: https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/twilio/outbound-call

Headers:

Content-Type: application/json

xi-api-key: [YOUR_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY] (The user will manually substitute this in Make.com).

Body (JSON Payload): The payload must use the three required parameters for the call, plus a custom_variables object to pass the personalization data.

Required ElevenLabs API Parameters:
Parameter Name	Data Type	Value/Mapping	Description
agent_id	string	[YOUR_AGENT_ID]	The unique ID of the ElevenLabs Agent (to be substituted by the user).
agent_phone_number_id	string	[YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER_ID]	The unique ID of the Twilio phone number connected to the agent (to be substituted by the user).
to_number	string	Map from Webhook (to_number)	The prospect's number.
custom_variables	object	See details below	Key/value pairs for personalization.

Export to Sheets

custom_variables Structure:
The agent's system prompt in ElevenLabs must reference these variables (e.g., "Start by saying: 'Hello, Jane, I noticed you [{{opener}}]...'").

Key (in custom_variables)	Value/Mapping
opener	Map from Webhook (personalized_opener)
name	Map from Webhook (prospect_name)

4. Expected Output Format
Provide the configuration details in a structured format that I can easily copy into a Make.com scenario or API documentation.

A. The JSON structure for the initial Clay Webhook payload (the input).

B. The complete, templated JSON payload for the Make.com HTTP Module (the output). Use placeholders like {{to_number}} and [PLACEHOLDER_FOR_ID] for easy substitution.

Why this prompt works:
Clear Roles: It establishes the exact role of each module (Webhook is the trigger, HTTP is the action).

Explicit Mapping: It clearly defines the input variables from Clay and how they must map to the output parameters for the ElevenLabs API.

Authentication Handled: It specifies the API key needs to be in a header (xi-api-key), which is standard for ElevenLabs.

Personalization: It specifically requests the inclusion of the custom_variables object, which is the key to passing the Clay-generated script line to the AI agent.
